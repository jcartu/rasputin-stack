# Qwen3-TTS OpenAI-compatible Server

An OpenAI-compatible TTS server for [Qwen3-TTS](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS)
with real-time audio streaming, voice cloning, and torch.compile optimizations.

Based on [groxaxo/Qwen3-TTS-Openai-Fastapi](https://github.com/groxaxo/Qwen3-TTS-Openai-Fastapi)
and [dffdeeq/Qwen3-TTS-streaming](https://github.com/dffdeeq/Qwen3-TTS-streaming).


## What this fork adds

- **Real-time audio streaming** — `stream: true` in the request body yields PCM
  chunks as the model generates them, instead of waiting for the full audio.
  Works for both built-in voices and voice cloning.
- **Voice library** — Save voice profiles and use them with `voice: "clone:MyVoice"`.
  The server auto-switches between CustomVoice and Base models as needed.
- **Voice prompt caching** — Speaker embeddings are computed once per profile and
  reused across requests. Saves ~0.7s per voice clone request.
- **torch.compile + CUDA graphs** — Configurable via `config.yaml`. The `optimized`
  backend compiles both streaming and non-streaming code paths on startup.
- **GPU keepalive** — Periodic matmul to prevent AMD DPM from downclocking the GPU
  after idle. Keeps TTFB consistent at ~0.3s instead of 0.85s after idle.
- **Pipecat voice agent** — Full voice assistant pipeline with WebRTC, Parakeet STT,
  LLM, and streaming TTS. End-to-end latency ~2s (down from ~7s).
  See [`install/pipecat/`](install/pipecat/).


## Compatibility

| Platform | Status |
|----------|--------|
| AMD ROCm (tested: Strix Halo gfx1151) | Tested, optimized |
| NVIDIA CUDA (Ampere, Ada, Blackwell) | Should work, not yet verified |
| CPU | Use groxaxo's `pytorch_cpu` backend instead |

The core features (streaming API, voice library, caching) are platform-agnostic.
torch.compile and CUDA graphs work on both CUDA and ROCm.

NVIDIA users: if you encounter issues, please open an issue. The streaming library
(dffdeeq) was originally developed and benchmarked on RTX 5090.


## Quick Start

```bash
# NVIDIA
docker compose up -d

# AMD ROCm
docker compose -f docker-compose.rocm.yml up -d
```

Models are downloaded from HuggingFace automatically on first start (~2.4 GB each).
First startup takes ~75 seconds for torch.compile warmup.

The server listens on port **8880** by default.


## Usage

### OpenAI-compatible API

```bash
# Non-streaming (compatible with OpenWebUI, SillyTavern, etc.)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "Hello world!", "voice": "alloy", "model": "tts-1"}' \
  --output speech.mp3

# Real-time streaming (for low-latency applications)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "Hello world!", "voice": "alloy", "model": "tts-1", "stream": true, "response_format": "pcm"}' \
  --output speech.pcm

# Voice cloning (auto-switches to Base model)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8880/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "Hello world!", "voice": "clone:MyVoice", "model": "tts-1-en"}' \
  --output speech.mp3
```

### Language hints

Append a language code to the model name for language-specific synthesis:

| Model | Language |
|-------|----------|
| `tts-1-en` | English |
| `tts-1-de` | German |
| `tts-1-zh` | Chinese |
| `tts-1-ja` | Japanese |
| `tts-1-ko` | Korean |
| `tts-1-fr` | French |
| `tts-1-es` | Spanish |
| `tts-1-ru` | Russian |
| `tts-1-pt` | Portuguese |
| `tts-1-it` | Italian |

### Voice mapping

| OpenAI voice | Qwen3-TTS speaker |

| echo | Ryan |
| fable | Serena |

| onyx | Eric |
| shimmer | Dylan |


## Configuration

The server reads `~/qwen3-tts/config.yaml` (or `$TTS_CONFIG`).

Key settings:

```yaml
default_model: 0.6B-CustomVoice

optimization:
  compile_mode: max-autotune     # torch.compile mode
  use_cuda_graphs: true          # CUDA graph capture
  streaming:
    decode_window_frames: 72     # AMD: use 72 (not 64 or 80). NVIDIA: 64 or 80 also work.
    emit_every_frames: 24        # ~3x redundancy ratio is optimal
```

See [config.yaml](config.yaml) for all options with comments.


## Performance

Benchmarked on AMD Radeon 8060S (Strix Halo), 0.6B model, after warmup:

| Mode | RTF | TTFB | Notes |
|------|-----|------|-------|
| Non-streaming, CustomVoice | 0.53-0.54x | full generation time | Best for OpenWebUI |
| Non-streaming, Voice Clone | 0.55-0.56x | full generation time | With cached prompt |
| Streaming, CustomVoice | 0.57x | ~0.3s | 6-8 chunks per request |
| Streaming, Voice Clone | 0.57x | ~0.3s | With cached prompt |

RTF = Real-Time Factor. Lower is faster. 0.54x means audio is generated ~1.85x
faster than real-time.

### Streaming tuning

The `decode_window_frames / emit_every_frames` ratio controls the trade-off between
latency (TTFB) and throughput (RTF):

- **~3x redundancy** is optimal (e.g. 72/24, 150/50, 300/100)
- Smaller windows = lower TTFB at the same ratio
- RTF is nearly identical regardless of absolute window size at the same ratio

AMD ROCm note: `decode_window_frames` values of 64 or less, and exactly 80, trigger
a CUDA graph capture bug that causes 5-10x slowdown. Use 72 or 84+.


## Voice Assistant Pipeline

The [`install/pipecat/`](install/pipecat/) directory contains a complete voice
assistant that combines STT, LLM, and TTS into a real-time WebRTC pipeline:

```
Browser (WebRTC)
    |
    v
Pipecat Pipeline
    |
    ├── STT: Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 (ONNX INT8, CPU, ~0.2s)
    ├── LLM: any OpenAI-compatible API (llamaswap, vLLM, etc.)
    └── TTS: Qwen3-TTS streaming (GPU, TTFB ~0.3s)
```

**End-to-end latency: ~2 seconds** (user stops speaking → bot starts speaking),
down from ~7 seconds through:

- Parakeet STT on CPU via [groxaxo's FastAPI wrapper](https://github.com/groxaxo/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-fastapi-openai) (replaces local Whisper, 20x+ realtime)
- Small LLM for fast TTFB (Ministral 3B Q8_0: ~0.5s TTFB)
- Streaming TTS with GPU keepalive (consistent 0.3s TTFB)
- SanitizedLLMService: merges consecutive user messages after voice interruptions
  (prevents template errors with strict chat templates like Ministral)

See [`install/pipecat/INSTALL.md`](install/pipecat/INSTALL.md) for setup instructions.

## Manual installation (without Docker)

```bash
# 1. Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/dingausmwald/Qwen3-TTS-Openai-Fastapi.git
cd Qwen3-TTS-Openai-Fastapi

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# 3. Install flash attention
# NVIDIA:
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
# AMD:
FLASH_ATTENTION_TRITON_AMD_ENABLE=TRUE pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation

# 4. Copy config
mkdir -p ~/qwen3-tts/voice_library
cp config.yaml ~/qwen3-tts/config.yaml

# 5. Start
./start_server.sh
```


## Voice Library

To use voice cloning with saved profiles, create a profile directory:

```
~/qwen3-tts/voice_library/profiles/
  my_voice/
    meta.json
    reference.wav
```

`meta.json` format:
```json
{
  "name": "MyVoice",
  "profile_id": "my_voice",
  "ref_audio_filename": "reference.wav",
  "ref_text": "Optional transcript of the reference audio.",
  "x_vector_only_mode": false,
  "language": "English",
  "task_type": "Base"
}
```

Then use `voice: "clone:MyVoice"` in API requests. The server auto-switches to
the Base model for voice cloning.
